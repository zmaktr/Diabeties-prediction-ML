## Diabeties prediction system using machine learning

### Project Workflow:

1) Import all dependencies for the project

2) Collect the data file analyse it + Seprate the data and labels into X & Y variables respectively

3) Standardize the data to have a common range between them

4) Split the data between training and test data

5) Training the model using scalar vector machine (SVM) model

5) Model evaluation predict outcome for both train and test data

6) Develop a predictive system
